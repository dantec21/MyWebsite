        <h2> Andrew Luck Retires from the NFL </h2>

          <p>After the game, Luck announced his decision during an impromptu 25-minute news conference. He said an official announcement <br> wasn't planned until Sunday afternoon, but he changed course once news broke during the game.
      "I've been stuck in this process," <br> Luck said, stopping several times to gather his emotions. "I haven't been able to live the life I want to live. It's taken the joy out of this <br>game ... the only way forward for me is to remove myself from football.

      "This is not an easy decision. It's the hardest decision of my <br> life. But it is the right decision for me.''

      Luck's early retirement ends what started as a promising career for the No. 1 overall pick in the <br> 2012 draft, chosen to replace Peyton Manning. Luck led the Colts to the playoffs in each of his first three seasons in the NFL, including <br> back-to-back AFC South titles and an appearance in the AFC Championship Game in 2014.

      But his career took a bad turn when he <br> suffered a shoulder injury in Week 3 of the 2015 season. He ended up missing 26 games -- including the entire 2017 season because <br> of shoulder, kidney and rib injuries. It was during the 2017 season while out that Luck questioned whether he would be able to continue <br> his career.
